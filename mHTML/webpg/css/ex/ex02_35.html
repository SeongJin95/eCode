    WhenAlice follows the White Rabbit down a rabbit hole, she
    finds herself in a land where she can change her size. She meets
    a Duchess with a pig for baby, a Cook that throws spoons, a 
    wise but mad Cheshire cat, the March Hare, Mad Hatter and a 
    Dormouse. A Caterpillar shows her how to adjust her height by
    eating from the right and left sides of a mushroom. With that
    knowledge, Alice is able to enter a beautiful garden to play 
    croquet with the Queen of Hearts. This game of croquet is played 
    with flamingos (mallets), balls (curled-up hedgehogs) and an army 
    of bent-over cards (arches). As the living croquet game continually 
    changes, the Queen as most of her quests arrested, but introduces 
    Alice to aGryphon and Mock Turtle</p>
